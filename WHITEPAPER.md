NLDSC Blockchain Whitepaper (Updated for Bonding Curve Mechanism)

Happy New Year 2026!

NLDSC (New LAODENGS Coin) was born from a real blockchain journey:
From learning to use exchanges, buying crypto via P2P, withdrawing and making on-chain transfers,
to understanding AMM pricing, and finally issuing a token through four.meme platform with a bonding curve mechanism.

NLDSC is not VC-backed, not a PPT project, and not a promise of profit.
It is a decentralized token experiment built on BNB Chain, where rules are written in code and price is dynamically determined by the bonding curve.

Token Sale & Bonding Curve

Total Supply: 20,260,000,000 NLDSC

Initial Purchase: Early buyers can acquire NLDSC directly from the bonding curve.

Dynamic Pricing: Price increases as more tokens are purchased. Early buyers pay less, later buyers pay more.

Raised Amount: The bonding curve tracks cumulative purchases (e.g., 12,000 USDT) and remaining tokens available (e.g., 794,849,898.2 NLDSC with 19.8 USDT value).

Liquidity Injection: When the market cap reaches $58,800, all funds from the bonding curve are deposited into PancakeSwap and some NLDSC may be burned to increase scarcity.

This mechanism ensures fair launch, prevents sniping, stabilizes price, and gradually provides liquidity.

Core Principles

Decentralization: The contract automatically manages available tokens; the creator cannot control or withdraw all supply.

Transparency: Purchases and price progression are visible on-chain.

Fairness: Early buyers are rewarded with lower prices, but no guarantees or profit promises exist.

Continuity: NLDSC continues a blockchain journey, now written openly on-chain.
