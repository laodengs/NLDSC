NLDSC (New LAODENGS Coin) Blockchain Whitepaper – 2026 Edition

Happy New Year 2026!

NLDSC (New LAODENGS Coin) is a decentralized token experiment born from a real blockchain journey:
From learning how to use exchanges, buying crypto via P2P, withdrawing and making on-chain transfers,
to understanding AMM pricing, and finally issuing a token on the four.meme platform using a bonding curve mechanism.

This is not a VC-backed token, not a PPT project, and not a promise of profit. NLDSC is built on BNB Chain, where rules are written in code and price is determined dynamically by the market and bonding curve.

1️⃣ Token Issuance & Platform Mechanism

Total Supply: Determined by the four.meme platform bonding curve mechanism. The creator does not control the full supply.

Token Release: Tokens are gradually released through the bonding curve for public purchase. Early buyers receive tokens at lower prices, while price rises automatically as more tokens are purchased.

Early Purchase / Anti-Sniping: Small early purchases help stabilize the initial price and prevent bots or speculators from manipulating the market.

2️⃣ Bonding Curve Dynamics

Dynamic Pricing: Price increases progressively according to the bonding curve formula. Early buyers pay less, later buyers pay more.

Cumulative Raised Amount: All purchases are tracked on-chain. For example, a cumulative 12,000 USDT has been raised so far.

Available Tokens: Remaining tokens in the bonding curve are available for purchase at prices determined by the curve.

The bonding curve ensures a fair launch, transparent price progression, and gradual market-driven liquidity.

3️⃣ Liquidity & Burn Mechanism

Liquidity Injection: When the token’s market cap reaches $58,800, all funds from the bonding curve are deposited into PancakeSwap to provide liquidity.

Token Burn: Part of the NLDSC in the bonding curve may be burned to increase scarcity and support price stability.

Progression: The higher the price climbs along the bonding curve, the more market value and liquidity are established.

This mechanism ensures price stability, scarcity, and long-term market health.

4️⃣ Creator & Governance

The creator cannot withdraw the full supply or control all tokens.

Handled entirely by the platform contract and bonding curve.

Transparency is maintained on-chain, with every purchase, price, and liquidity injection visible to the public.

5️⃣ Core Principles

Decentralization: Token distribution and pricing are automated and market-driven.

Transparency: All transactions, purchases, and price progression are visible on-chain.

Fairness: Early buyers are rewarded with lower prices, but no promises of profit exist.

Continuity: NLDSC continues a personal blockchain journey, now written openly for the community.

6️⃣ Why NLDSC

For those who still believe in what blockchain was meant to be:

Code > Narratives

Market > Promises

Early participation > Speculation

NLDSC — New LAODENGS Coin.
A real experiment in decentralized issuance, bonding curves, and open-market dynamics.
