NLDSC (New LAODENGS Coin)
Blockchain Whitepaper (English Edition)
1. Overview

NLDSC (New LAODENGS Coin) is a decentralized digital asset project born from a real and verifiable blockchain journey. The project originates from an individual learning and participating in crypto from zero — starting with centralized exchanges, P2P trading, on-chain transfers, and ultimately writing and deploying a smart contract independently.

NLDSC does not rely on venture capital narratives, artificial hype, or guaranteed returns. Instead, it emphasizes transparency, simplicity, and adherence to the original principles of blockchain technology.

2. Background

In recent years, many blockchain projects have focused on marketing narratives, institutional backing, and short-term speculation, often neglecting decentralization and user sovereignty.

NLDSC was created as a response to this trend:

No private fundraising

No institutional control

No hidden allocations

Only publicly deployed code, open rules, and market-driven consensus.

3. Core Principles

NLDSC follows several fundamental principles:

Code is Law
Smart contract logic defines the rules and is publicly verifiable on-chain.

Fair Launch
No presale, no private allocation, and no privileged access.

Market-Driven Pricing
Price is determined solely by decentralized AMM trading mechanisms.

Transparency Over Promises
The project makes no profit guarantees or price commitments.

4. Technology Architecture

Blockchain: BNB Chain (BSC)

Token Standard: BEP-20

Wallet Support: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and other BSC-compatible wallets

Trading Model: Decentralized exchanges using AMM mechanisms (e.g., PancakeSwap)

4.1 Smart Contract Design

Simple and auditable transfer logic

No hidden blacklist or freeze functions

Contract behavior is fully transparent on-chain

5. Tokenomics

Token Name: New LAODENGS Coin

Symbol: NLDSC

Decimals: 18

Total Supply: Defined by the deployed smart contract

5.1 Distribution Philosophy

Majority of tokens enter public circulation

Liquidity is provided openly

No excessive team-controlled supply designed for long-term selling pressure

5.2 Liquidity & Pricing

NLDSC uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model based on the constant product formula:

x × y = k

Initial price is set by the first liquidity provider

Subsequent price movement is determined by market trading behavior

6. Use Cases

NLDSC is designed as an experimental and community-driven token with potential use cases including:

Decentralized payments

Web3 services and applications

Community incentives and participation

Exploratory DeFi and on-chain experiments

These use cases may evolve organically through community participation.

7. Community & Governance

NLDSC adopts a lightweight governance approach:

Community discussion precedes formal governance mechanisms

Transparency is prioritized over complex voting systems

DAO structures may be explored gradually when appropriate

8. Roadmap
Phase 1: Deployment

Smart contract deployment

Initial liquidity creation

Wallet and DEX integration

Phase 2: Community Growth

Community formation

Public documentation and branding

Platform listings and visibility

Phase 3: Exploration

Web3 payment testing

Community-driven tools

Additional on-chain experiments

9. Risk Disclosure

NLDSC is a high-risk digital asset. Token prices are volatile and determined entirely by the market. Participation does not constitute investment advice, and users should only participate with funds they can afford to lose.

10. Conclusion

NLDSC is a transparent on-chain experiment.

It does not promise financial success, but it does guarantee:

Open rules

Verifiable code

A real blockchain history

NLDSC exists for those who still believe in the original meaning of blockchain.
